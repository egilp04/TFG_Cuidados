    "DESCRIPTION": "CuidaDos is a platform aiming to be a safe and efficient intermediary for hiring care services for the elderly or those needing daily assistance. We are a digital care platform created with the aim of improving the quality of life of people who need support in their daily lives. Our team is made up of professionals from the technological and social fields who share a common vision: to make access to care services simple, secure and transparent. We believe that caring for people should be based on trust, professionalism and closeness, which is why we work to connect users with specialized care service providers. The platform was created in response to a real and growing social need. Population aging, the increase in dependent people and the lack of time for many families have led to a high demand for care services. However, finding reliable companies, comparing options or managing issues is not always easy. We identified the absence of a single space where users could safely and easily hire care services with support throughout the entire process. Our commitment is to create an inclusive, intuitive and reliable digital environment that contributes to dignifying the care sector and improving the lives of those who need it most.",
